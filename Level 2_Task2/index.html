        <hr>
        <p> Augusta Ada Byron is born 10th December 1815, as the daughter of Anne Isabella Noel-Byron (known as Annabella) and famous English poet Lord Byron. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated every year on the second Tuesday of October month to celebrate the contribution of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths in the memory of the world's first computer programmer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1833 Ada Lovelace met the mathematician Charles Babbage, who had designed a calculating machine called the Difference Engine. Lovelace was inspired by the prototype of the Difference Engine and became Babbage's lifelong friend. Babbage had a new project in mind, a much more-advanced machine, the Analytical Engine. In 1843 Lovelace translated a French paper that Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea wrote about the Analytical Engine. She also added thousands of words of her own notes to the paper. Lovelace realized that the Analytical Engine could carry out an extensive sequence of mathematical operations. The example she wrote of one such sequence—how to calculate Bernoulli numbers—is regarded by computer historians as the first computer program. She even speculated that the Analytical Engine could be used to perform operations on "other things besides number," such as musical notes.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology and mesmerism.After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects.
        </p>
        <br>
          <p>Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852,from uterine cancer The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants.</p>
